## Overview

The Product Health Scanner application is composed of several React components that handle different aspects of the user interface. These components are organized to provide a clean, modular structure that's easy to maintain and extend.

## Component Structure

## Component Integration

All components are exported through the `index.ts` file in the components directory, making them easily importable throughout the application:

```typescript
export { ErrorDisplay } from './ErrorDisplay';
export { HealthWarningDisplay } from './HealthWarningDisplay';
export { LoadingIndicator } from './LoadingIndicator';
export { ProductDisplay } from './ProductDisplay';
```

## Styling

Components use React Native's StyleSheet API for consistent styling. The styling follows a clean, modern design with appropriate spacing, typography, and color schemes.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the component library include:

1. **Enhanced UI Components**:
   - More interactive elements for better user engagement
   - Improved accessibility features
   - Dark mode support

2. **Additional Components**:
   - User profile management UI
   - Scan history viewer
   - Chat interface for conversational AI
   - Alternative product recommendation display

3. **Component Libraries**:
   - Consider integrating a UI component library like React Native Elements or NativeBase
   - Custom component themes for consistent branding

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement React.memo for performance improvements
   - Optimize re-renders with useCallback and useMemo
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
