## Introduction

The Product Health Scanner is a mobile application that empowers users to make informed decisions about their food purchases by providing intelligent, personalized health analysis. The app leverages multiple AI technologies to identify food products through barcode scanning, image recognition, or text search, and then analyzes the ingredients against research-backed health data and government-approved sources.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Method Product Identification**
   - Barcode scanning using device camera
   - Image recognition for products without barcodes
   - Text search for manual product lookup

2. **Personalized Health Analysis**
   - AI-powered ingredient analysis based on user's health profile
   - Warnings for allergens, dietary restrictions, and health conditions
   - Identification of beneficial ingredients

3. **Conversational Interface**
   - Chat with an AI assistant about products and alternatives
   - Personalized product recommendations
   - Context-aware responses based on user's health profile

4. **Scan History and Tracking**
   - Save and review scan history
   - Filter by date, warnings, or product categories
   - Offline access to previously scanned products

5. **User Profile Management**
   - Create and maintain health profiles with allergies, dietary restrictions, and conditions
   - Personalized recommendations based on profile
