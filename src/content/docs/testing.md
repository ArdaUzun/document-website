## Overview

The Product Health Scanner application has a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The testing framework is built on Jest, with additional tools for specific testing needs.

## Testing Stack

- **Jest** - JavaScript testing framework
- **React Test Renderer** - For testing React components
- **Mocking libraries** - For simulating external dependencies

## Test Structure

Tests are organized to mirror the source code structure:

```
src/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── ConversationalAIService.test.ts
│   ├── DataEnrichmentService.test.ts
│   ├── ErrorHandlingService.test.ts
│   ├── HealthAnalysisService.test.ts
│   ├── ImageRecognitionService.test.ts
│   ├── integration.test.ts
│   ├── models.test.ts
│   ├── performance.test.ts
│   ├── ProductIdentificationService.test.ts
│   ├── RecommendationService.test.ts
│   ├── ScanHistoryService.test.ts
│   └── UserProfileService.test.ts
```

## Running Tests

### Single Run

To run all tests once:

```bash
npm test
```

### Watch Mode

To run tests in watch mode (re-runs tests when files change):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Coverage Report

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This will create an HTML coverage report in the `coverage/` directory.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual functions and classes, mocking external dependencies. Examples include:

- Testing model methods
- Testing service methods with mocked dependencies
- Testing component rendering with different props

Example from `ProductIdentificationService.test.ts`:

```typescript
it('should return product data when a valid barcode is provided', async () => {
  const barcode = '1234567890';
  const mockProductData = {
    code: barcode,
    product_name: 'Test Product',
    brands: 'Test Brand',
    ingredients_text: 'water, sugar, salt',
    nutriments: { calories: 100 },
    image_url: 'http://example.com/image.jpg',
  };
  mockAxiosInstance.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { status: 1, product: mockProductData } });

  const result = await productIdentificationService.identifyByBarcode(barcode);

  expect(result).toBeInstanceOf(ProductInfoModel);
  expect(result?.name).toBe('Test Product');
  expect(result?.barcode).toBe(barcode);
  expect(mockAxiosInstance.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`/product/${barcode}.json`);
});
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. These tests typically:

- Test service interactions without fully mocking dependencies
- Verify data flow between components
- Test API integrations with controlled test data

Example from `integration.test.ts` (conceptual):

```typescript
it('should complete a full product identification and analysis flow', async () => {
  // Mock external API responses
  // Execute the full flow: identification -> enrichment -> analysis
  // Verify the final result
});
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests ensure the application meets performance requirements:

- Response time measurements
- Memory usage tracking
- Concurrent user simulation

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user interactions with the application. These tests:

- Use tools like Detox for mobile testing
- Test complete user flows
- Verify UI elements and interactions

## Writing Tests

### Test Structure

Tests should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  // Setup code (Arrange)
  
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', async () => {
      // Arrange - set up test data and mocks
      
      // Act - call the method under test
      
      // Assert - verify the results
    });
  });
});
```

### Mocking

Use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the code under test:

```typescript
const mockAxiosInstance = {
  get: jest.fn(),
};

beforeEach(() => {
  productIdentificationService = new ProductIdentificationService(mockAxiosInstance as any);
});

afterEach(() => {
  mockAxiosInstance.get.mockClear();
});
```

### Test Data

Use factories or builder patterns for creating test data:

```typescript
const createTestUserProfile = (overrides = {}) => {
  return new UserProfileModel({
    id: 'test-user',
    allergies: [],
    dietaryRestrictions: [],
    healthConditions: [],
    ...overrides
  });
};
```

## Test Coverage

The project aims for comprehensive test coverage:

- **Models**: 100% coverage for business logic methods
- **Services**: 90%+ coverage, focusing on core functionality
- **Components**: 80%+ coverage for critical user interactions
- **Utils**: 100% coverage for utility functions

Run `npm run test:coverage` to check current coverage levels.

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically in the CI pipeline:

1. On every pull request
2. Before merging to main branch
3. On scheduled builds

The CI configuration is in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Best Practices

### Test Design

1. **Keep tests focused**: Each test should verify one behavior
2. **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly state what is being tested
3. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error conditions and boundary values
4. **Avoid testing implementation details**: Focus on behavior rather than internal structure

### Mocking Strategy

1. **Mock external dependencies**: APIs, databases, file systems
2. **Don't mock value objects**: Test with real data models
3. **Use realistic mock data**: Represent actual API responses
4. **Reset mocks between tests**: Ensure test isolation

### Performance

1. **Keep tests fast**: Avoid unnecessary setup or teardown
2. **Use focused tests**: Run only relevant tests during development
3. **Parallelize when possible**: Take advantage of Jest's parallel execution

### Maintenance

1. **Update tests with code changes**: Keep tests in sync with implementation
2. **Remove obsolete tests**: Delete tests for removed functionality
3. **Refactor test code**: Apply the same quality standards to test code

## Debugging Tests

When tests fail:

1. Run the specific failing test: `npm test -- -t "test name"`
2. Use `console.log` statements to inspect values
3. Use Jest's debug mode if needed
4. Check that mocks are properly configured

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the testing strategy include:

1. **Enhanced End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement Detox for mobile E2E testing
   - Add visual regression testing

2. **Property-Based Testing**:
   - Use libraries like fast-check for generative testing
   - Test with a wider range of inputs

3. **Contract Testing**:
   - Verify API contracts with providers
   - Ensure compatibility with external services

4. **Mutation Testing**:
   - Use tools like Stryker to measure test quality
   - Identify weakly tested code paths

5. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Automated accessibility checks
   - Screen reader testing
